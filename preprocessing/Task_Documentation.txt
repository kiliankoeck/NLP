For this milestone, we first fetched the raw plain text protocols of the austrian parliament's API with the help of chatGPT. 

We then inspedted the data and thought about which data is relevant for the next steps. We decided that we want to keep the speakers and the speech text. 
We then had to think about how to extract that data only, and came up with the regex patterns used in the python file called "extract_text.py". 

Once we had that cleaned data, we used the sparcy library to create the final connl-u files.
